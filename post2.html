            <p>Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are transformative technologies that alter our perception of the real world. While they share some similarities, they serve distinct purposes and offer unique experiences.</p>

            <h3>Augmented Reality (AR)</h3>
            <p>AR overlays digital content onto the real world, enhancing our surroundings with computer-generated information. It integrates virtual elements seamlessly into the user's environment. AR is often experienced through mobile devices, smart glasses, or heads-up displays.</p>

            <h3>Virtual Reality (VR)</h3>
            <p>VR, on the other hand, immerses users in a completely virtual environment, shutting out the real world. It creates a simulated reality through specialized headsets, providing an all-encompassing experience. VR is widely used in gaming, simulations, and virtual tours.</p>

            <h3>Key Differences</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>**Interaction with the Real World:** AR enhances real-world experiences by adding digital elements, while VR completely replaces the real world with a virtual environment.</li>
                <li>**Devices:** AR is often experienced through devices like smartphones and smart glasses, whereas VR requires dedicated headsets for an immersive experience.</li>
                <li>**Use Cases:** AR finds applications in navigation, education, and enhancing daily activities. VR is commonly used in gaming, simulations, training, and entertainment.</li>
                <li>**Immersiveness:** While both AR and VR are immersive, VR provides a more intense, fully isolated experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Understanding the differences between AR and VR is crucial as these technologies continue to shape various industries. Whether enhancing reality or creating entirely new ones, both AR and VR offer exciting possibilities for the future.</p>
